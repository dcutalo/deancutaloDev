## Project Idea
My teammates and I, consisting of 6 members total, decided to call our project gaspal. The goal for the project was to allow users to see how many gallons of gas a trip would take. Users would create a new trip giving start and end points. The app would then give them the amount of gallons of gas the trip would take and be able to compare that with the amount of gas they have currently.

## Project Setup

After my teammates and I discussed the tech stack we would use it was time to setup the project. We all agreed on using the MERN stack, I volunteered to set up the project for development as this was my first time doing so and I thought it would be a good learning experience. I started off by creating a git repository, then it was time to setup the dependencies for the project using homebrew. Homebrew is available to macOS and linux, for the entirety of the project I developed on mac. After I created the project and all of its dependencies it was time to create a comprehensive readme so my team was aware of the development process. The readme contained information pertaining to project setup, feature development, deploying, production and general git references. At first I did not properly setup the merge and code review process on github, each teammate was able to directly push to main without any other teammates approval. After realizing this I changed the process making each member create a feature branch and having them do pull requests. After the pull request was made one other member needed to review the code and give the thumbs up before merging with main.
